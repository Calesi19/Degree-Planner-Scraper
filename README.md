# Overview

Degree Planner is a platform that students at BYU-Pathway Worldwide, an online educational institution, use to schedule what classes they want to take each semester. Sometimes, bugs in the system cause Degree Planner to not work properly, so the school has a team dedicated to trouble shooting these student planners.

My goal with this project is to create a program that can facilitate troubleshooting these faulty Degree Planners. Using Python Web Scraping, the program should extract useful information from the Degree Planner.

This is also an opportunity for me to learn about the basics of Web Scraping since it's my first time delving into this subject. 


In the following link, you can see a short demonstration of how the program works.

# Development Environment


I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE and Python version 3.9 as my language.

I've included the following Python libraries in the program:
* pyautogui
* time
* tkinter
* BeautifulSoup
* os
* requests

To learn how web scraping works, I completed the Codeacademy course for Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup.

# Future Work


The following is a list of features that can be added in the future:
* Comparing student's scheduled courses against the Academic Catalog documents
* Using web scraping to check what classes the student has already completed.
* Adding automation, to check multiple planners at the same time, while flagging any errors found.
